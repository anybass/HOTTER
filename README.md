# ðŸ”¥ HOTTER ðŸ”¥

Welcome to the code base for the paper "HOTTER: Hierarchical Optimal Topic Transport with Explanatory Context Representations" published in the ["Findings of EMNLP 2021"](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.418/).

ðŸ’¥ HOTTER is a document meta-distance, combining an LDA topic model with contextual word embeddings from BERT.

ðŸ’¥ HOTTER is an extension of HOTT by Yurochkin et al. ([code](https://github.com/IBM/HOTT), [publication](http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/8438-hierarchical-optimal-transport-for-document-representation.pdf)). We use their code for the underlying distance computation.

## Quick Start Guide

This code works on Linux distributions or on Google Colab. Simply download the code to one destination and run the Jupyter Notebook *HOTTER.ipynb* which shall guide you through the process.

**Hint:** Depending on the dataset and BERT model you want to use, you need to make sure to meet the respective requirements regarding the device memory.
 
## Prerequisites
